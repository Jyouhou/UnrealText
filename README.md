We release (Baidu/Google Drive):

- Large-scale Latin/English and multilingual [synthetic scene text datasets](https://github.com/Jyouhou/UnrealText/blob/master/ReleaseNote.md#1-synthetic-scene-text-dataset-from-3d-world)
- [Source code and instructions](https://github.com/Jyouhou/UnrealText/tree/master/code/Tutorial-on-deployment.md) on how to use them
- [Demo UE project](https://github.com/Jyouhou/UnrealText/blob/master/ReleaseNote.md#2-demo-ue-projects) and all [30 precompiled scene executables](https://github.com/Jyouhou/UnrealText/blob/master/ReleaseNote.md#4-packaged-scene-executables)
- [Re-annotated scene text recognition dataset](https://github.com/Jyouhou/Case-Sensitive-Scene-Text-Recognition-Datasets) used in our evaluation
